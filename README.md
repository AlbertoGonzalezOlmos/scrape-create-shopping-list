# Distilling web information 

The website sundpaabudget.dk is a great resource to get diverse, healty and tasty meals every week. 

In this repository I am automating what we have been doing every week for a while now in my family:

1. get recipes and ingredients from the latest week in sundpaabudget.dk, flexitarisk plan.
1. use `llama3.1 70b` (or 405b) through `groq` or `togetherai` to group ingredients by aile and create a shopping list to print/send by email.

TODO:
- asynchronous categorization of ingredients.
- send list of recipes and ingredients to a list of email addresses.
