# Distilling web information 

The website sundpaabudget.dk is a great resource for weekly planning diverse, healty and tasty meals. 

In this repository I am automating what we have been doing every week for a while now in my family:

1. go to the latest week in sundpaabudget.dk in the flexitarisk plan.
1. copy and pase every list of ingredients into a text file.
1. use llama3 and groq to:
1. group ingredients by category and create a shopping list to print.
