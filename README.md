# Destilling web information 

The website sundpaabudget.dk is a great resource for weekly planning diverse, healty and tasty meals. 

In this repository I am automating what we have been doing every week for a while now in my family:

1 - go to the latest week in sundpaabudget.dk in the flexitarisk plan.
2 - copy and pase every list of ingredients into gpt4.
3 - translate the list to English.
4 - group ingredients by category and create a shopping list to print.
